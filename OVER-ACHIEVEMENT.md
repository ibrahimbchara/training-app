# 🚀 Over-Achievement Features

## 🎉 **Smart Target Management!**

The app now handles over-achievement intelligently - when people exceed their targets, it celebrates their success without penalizing them the next day!

## ✨ **How It Works:**

### 🎯 **Target Achievement Levels:**

**🚀 Over Achieved (110%+):**
- Shows "Over Achieved! +X extra" instead of negative remaining
- Purple color to celebrate exceptional performance
- Extra reps DON'T affect tomorrow's target

**🏆 Perfect Completion (100%):**
- Shows "Target Completed! 🎉"
- Green color for perfect achievement
- No carry-forward needed

**✅ Excellent (90-99%):**
- Shows remaining reps needed
- Green color for great performance
- Small deficit carries to next day

**⚠️ Partial (50-89%):**
- Shows remaining reps needed
- Yellow/orange color for encouragement
- Remaining reps carry to next day

**❌ Poor/Missed (0-49%):**
- Shows remaining reps needed
- Red color for attention needed
- All missed reps carry to next day

## 🔄 **Carry-Forward Logic:**

### **Before (Old System):**
- Person does 120/100 push-ups → Tomorrow needs 80 push-ups (penalized!)
- Person does 80/100 push-ups → Tomorrow needs 120 push-ups

### **After (New System):**
- Person does 120/100 push-ups → Tomorrow needs 100 push-ups (normal target!)
- Person does 80/100 push-ups → Tomorrow needs 120 push-ups (20 carried forward)

## 🎨 **Visual Indicators:**
